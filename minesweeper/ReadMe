# Minesweeper Game

This is a classic Minesweeper game implemented using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Rules

1. The game board consists of a grid of cells.
2. Some cells contain hidden mines.
3. The objective is to reveal all cells without mines.
4. Clicking on a cell reveals its content:
   - If the cell contains a mine, you lose the game.
   - If the cell is empty, it reveals the number of adjacent cells containing mines.
5. Right-clicking on a cell marks it as a potential mine.
6. The game is won when all cells without mines are revealed and all mines are marked.
